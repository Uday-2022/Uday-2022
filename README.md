# Key Highlights âœ¨

-**Experience**: I have been working with MAIT since June 2021 in Research & Analysis. I focus in my work more on automating repetitive tasks, Data management, building models to learn data better, and reproducible report writing using Python & R markdown, Ad-hoc reports and Power-BI Dashboards.
-**GitHub Profile**: I'm currently working on building my GitHub profile with Data Science & Econometrics Applications on Macro-Economics & Finance.
-**Passion**: I'm passionate about working with data, exploring statistics & econometrics, and applying data science concepts to make meaningful inferences. 
-**Continuous skill Development**: My journey in data is fueled by my ongoing M.Sc. in Financial Engineering from WorldQuant University (WQU) and continuous learning through the Data Science Lab at WQU. Also, I took short courses from MOOCs, such as Macro-Econometrics Forecasting and Macro-Economic Diagnostic by IMF. I have recently completed the Executive Development Course on Applied Financial Risk Analytics course provided by IIM Kashipur and Introduction to AI using Python by IIT-Kanpur.
-**Objective**: My objective is to develop my skills further and apply them to solve real-world problems.

## Background

I graduated from Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College (South Campus, Delhi University) with a B.A (Hons) in Economics. I have completed my Masters in Economics from IGNOU. After completing my bachelor's, I was sure about working in the Econometrics field. I joined an E-Learning company who wants statistics & econometrics. I started looking for relevant courses and upgrading my skills. I took up a lot of courses ranging from in-personal courses, courses provided by MOOCs, Linkedin Learning, Premier Institutes like IIM and IIT, and now with a foreign university (WQU).

I'm a results-driven Data Analyst with a strong background in research and analysis, currently transitioning into data science. Experienced in utilizing data analysis, data visualization, automating tasks and periodic reproducible reports, and applying machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques as needed for projects. Proficient in Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI, with hands-on experience in implementing and automating workflows. Eager to leverage data analysis and econometrics expertise to drive business value in a dynamic organization.
