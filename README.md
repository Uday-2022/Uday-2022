# Hi, I'm Uday Khanna üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about working with data, exploring statistics, econometrics, and applying data science concepts to make meaningful inferences. My journey in the world of data is fueled by my ongoing M.Sc. in Financial Engineering from WorldQuant University (WQU) and continuous learning through the Data Science Lab at WQU.

### üöÄ My Journey

I'm currently deepening my understanding of data science, automation, financial engineering, and econometrics, aiming to solve complex problems and derive insights from data. My GitHub repositories serve as a sandbox where I apply, experiment, and iterate on the concepts I learn. My approach is methodical and systematic, ensuring that every concept I learn is applied practically and comprehensively.

### üß† What I'm Learning

- **Econometrics**: Exploring various econometric models to understand and predict financial phenomena. Note: I have already completed the Macroeconometrics using EViews course provided by the IMF.
- **Data Science**: Revising core data science concepts, including machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Note: I have already completed Introduction to AI provided by IIT Kanpur.
- **Statistics**: Applying statistical techniques to draw inferences and uncover hidden patterns in data.
- **Financial Engineering**: Integrating financial theory with mathematical modeling to optimize financial decision-making, a focus of my ongoing M.Sc. Financial Engineering course.

### üîç What You'll Find in My Repositories

- **Structured Learning**: My repositories are organized to reflect a step-by-step learning process. Each project is designed to build upon the previous one, showcasing a clear learning curve and understanding of the material.
- **Practical Applications**: You'll find applications of data science and econometrics in financial contexts, where I implement theories and methods on real datasets.
- **Documentation and Code Clarity**: I believe in writing clean, well-documented code. Each project comes with a comprehensive README and inline comments to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

### üå± Currently Working On

- Developing a robust **Econometric Model** to analyze and predict financial market behaviour (Niftybees ETF).
- Applying **Time Series Analysis** to financial data. I will apply time series analysis to forecast Niftybees ETF value.
- I will apply **Machine Learning** Concepts on the same or extended data.
